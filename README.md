# Simple Color File

This tiny, free and open source Windows Desktop app lets you save colors to **Simple Color Files**.

Start by **typing** a hexadecimal color code (such as *#BC1233*), or a HTML color name (such as *DodgerBlue*). You can **preview** the color, as it fills the bottom half of the interface, in real-time, as you type. You can use the *Pick Color* link button to open a Color dialog box, and **visually** select a color. And you can even double-click the color preview rectangle to select a **random** color.

After typing or selecting a color, click the _**Save**_ button to open the *Save As* dialog box. You can customize the location and file name, or simply accept the defaults, and click *Save* one more time. That's it! Your color has been saved.

You can now open the Simple Color File and view your color using **any** browser, on **any** PC, smartphone, or tablet.

# The Simple Color File Format

This is how a Simple Color File (`ColorOrangeRed.html`) looks like:

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Color OrangeRed</title>
    </head>
    <body style="background: OrangeRed">
    </body>
</html>
```

It's a standard HTML file, so it is highly **portable**, browser independent, and platform **independent**.

You can open it from within your favorite browser, or tap/click/double-click it in file managers to open it with the default browser. It should work on **any** browser, PC, smartphone, or tablet.
